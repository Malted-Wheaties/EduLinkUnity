# EduLinkUnity
## Depriciated - Poor user experience, very slow, and contains major security flaws. Use [this](https://github.com/Malted-Wheaties/EduLink-Bolt/) instead.
### An unofficial desktop client for OvernetData's EduLinkOne service


### To use the program, head to [releases](https://github.com/Malted-Wheaties/EduLinkUnity/releases)
#### It only supports Windows at the moment, and is packaged as an installer for ease of use.
