# EduLinkUnity
## An unofficial desktop client for OvernetData's EduLinkOne service


### To use the program, head to [releases](https://github.com/Malted-Wheaties/EduLinkUnity/releases)
#### It only supports Windows at the moment, and is packaged as an installer for ease of use.
#### Linux, then Mac builds in the future. Then AUR :)
--------
##### Note
The early iterations of the application will feel clunky and difficult to use; this will improve over time as bugs are fixed and things are smoothed out.
When finished this will be a good-looking, easy to use and quick way to view EduLink info for daily use.
